# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to search for a city and view the current and future  weather conditions. The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data and dynamically updates the HTML and CSS to display the information. It also stores the search history in localStorage, allowing users to quickly access previously searched cities.
